    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="body-text">
        SCLA 11100: Text and Context taught me about the U.S.’s cultural, social, and academic landscapes through reading, writing, and conversation. We explored American values, public speaking, and the benefits of intercultural communication. Overall, the class was relevant and engaging. In this section, I discuss three topics that particularly caught my attention.

    <!-- Topic 1 -->
    <article>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Importance of Intercultural Interactions</h3>
      <p class="body-text">
        In Importance of Intercultural Interactions, I highlighted the crucial role of understanding and engaging with cultures beyond my own. Through projects like Video Blog 2 and readings on global perspectives, I discovered that open-minded cross-cultural communication fosters stronger connections and reduces misunderstandings. As an international student, these skills have enabled me to build meaningful relationships on campus and beyond. By actively listening to diverse viewpoints and collaborating on assignments, I refined my intercultural competence, preparing me to navigate multicultural environments with empathy and clarity.

    <!-- Topic 2 -->
    <article>
      <h3 class="subtitle">American Values Around Me</h3>
      <p class="body-text">
        Through our study of “American Ways” and class discussions, I examined key American values such as equality, freedom, and individualism. I observed how these ideals influence everyday behaviors—from personal accountability in classroom participation to the emphasis on self-expression in group projects. Understanding this cultural framework helped me adapt to social expectations and enhanced my awareness of how values shape interactions. By reflecting on these concepts, I not only improved my intercultural understanding but also learned to engage more effectively in academic and community settings.

    </article>

    <!-- Topic 3 -->
    <article>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Public Speaking &amp; Presence</h3>
      <p class="body-text">
        The course emphasized public speaking through presentations and video blogs, allowing me to develop my ability to organize ideas clearly and engage audiences effectively. Feedback from Dr. Goodrich and classmates sharpened my delivery, helped me manage stage presence, and refine my speech structure. Through rehearsals and peer reviews, I learned to craft persuasive messages and adapt my tone for different contexts. This skill set will benefit future academic presentations, professional meetings, and leadership roles, equipping me with confidence and clarity when addressing diverse audiences.
